/*So maybe I can store some personal questions here.


    These are improvements that need to be included in the readme, in 
    order to tell the difference between what I've done and what was 
    followed in the tutorial.
    To do (to improve on the tutorial):

     - Finish the tutorial first!

     - Learn the rules in order to create an autosolver (After finishing)

     - Add more boards with some kind of randomizer process.


     - create more themes with the selectors, do something similiar 
     to the dark and light screen settings. Also try to make the theme
     change instant, not when you press start game.

        Because the tiles id/names come up as "undefined" in the 
    console log therefore I'm not able to switch the theme mid game, I
    came up with a solution. keep track of the theme selected and change
    it during generation. So now you select your theme to begin. I achieved 
    my goal but it'd be a better challenge if the theme could be changed
    mid game. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Questions
    
    1. Where does the creation of the board itself begin? Explain.

    The tutorial guide added a border to each tile by adding <border: 1px black;>
    to a variable called with <document.queryselectorall(.tile);>. Anything created
    with a call to this .css variable will gain its attributes. This was done first
    through clearPrevious();.
    The board and .tile elements in the .css fil were centered and made the proper 
    size that would automatically push the next elements down a line after 9 elements.
    You can change the size but if the ratio of the sizes of the tiles, font and board
    aren't adjusted appropriately, you won't have a proper 9x9 board.  
    After setting each future paragraph elements attributes (while simultaneously 
    removing the previous board). We create a for loop which will create a tile
    for each itteration and attach it to the overall 'board' id. Other adjustments
    outside of the .css file can be made, such as the two if statements that more 
    heavier bolden the bottom and right sides of the proper paragraph element id's.
    The base element or the board itself is also created in the .css file.
    You'll notice that at the end of the for loop of generateBoard. Each tile
    create is lastly fitted to the board id by appending the tile to it. 

    2. Where does the interaction between the user and board begin? Explain.

    3. Creating a timer/working with time, is good knowledge for most websites 
    Explain how it was done.


    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    *Notes | 
    
    *So an id is something to label an element in the .html file in order to 
    later access it in the javascript file. 

    *Difference between let and var is 
    let is defined within the scope of a single block (if, for loop, etc.)
    var is restricted to a function at the least or a global variable as the most.

    *.css selectors - So it seems that .tile, the .css selector, is holding the data
    for all tiles created both before and after they're created.
